# My Awesome Presentation

<!-- This is the title slide with centered title -->

---

## Introduction

Welcome to this presentation about title slides!

- First point about layouts
- Second point about styling
- Third point about functionality

<!-- Remember to explain the difference between title and content slides -->

---

## Key Features

The title slide uses a centered layout, perfect for:

- Opening your presentation
- Making a strong first impression
- Setting the tone

---

# Another Title Slide?

This slide has a single # but it's not the first slide, so it uses the Title and Content layout, not the Title Slide layout.

- Only the FIRST slide with # gets the centered title treatment
- All subsequent slides use Title and Content layout
- This ensures consistency throughout your deck

---

## Conclusion

- Title slides are automatically detected
- First slide with single # = centered title
- All other slides = title/body layout
- Speaker notes work on all slide types
